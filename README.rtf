Hello!

Let’s Add is a dog-themed arithmetic game that is designed for children ages 6 and up testing operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

This application only runs on the Windows operating system. In order to run Let’s Add on Mac, you must first install a Virtual Machine to gain access to a Windows operating system.

First, you must download the Lets_Add.rar and then unzip/unarchive it. This will provide a folder that will include all of the code and the executable. Most of the code resides in the main.py and helper.py, while the rest are dependencies such as sound, images, and text files. The executable file is named main.exe. Your operating system needs to have at least Python 3.0 and the latest version of Pygame installed to run smoothly. For a smoother gaming experience, you need a screen size of at least 1400x900 or larger. For audio, speakers or headphones are necessary. In order to play the game, you need a functional mouse and keyboard. The application requires a RAM size of at least 1 GB and 150 MB of free storage. The instructions on how to play the game reside in “How To Play” under “Settings”. Once you have met the requirements, simply double click main.exe to run the game!
